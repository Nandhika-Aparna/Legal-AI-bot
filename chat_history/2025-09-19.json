Specifically, the relevant excerpt states:\n\n\"have completed 21 years of age and the bride 18 years of age, at the time of marriage [Section 5(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act].\"\n\nThis suggests that while the law prescribes these minimum ages, a marriage conducted when one or both parties are below the requisite age is not automatically void, but is punishable under Section 18."

    "content": "The POCSO Act, or the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, was enacted by the Indian Parliament in 2012 to address and tackle sexual offences against children. This act is gender-neutral, which means it applies to all children, irrespective of gender. \n\nKey highlights include:\n\n1. **Special Protection for Children:** Recognizing the vulnerability of children, the Act was formulated to provide greater protection and legal remedies specifically tailored for children who are victims of sexual offences.\n\n2. **Procedure for Recording Statements:** Chapter VI of the POCSO Act deals with the procedures for recording the statements of children. Section 24, for example, mandates protecting the child's identity when statements are recorded by the police.\n\n3. **Mandatory Reporting and Legal Aid:** Any suspicion or knowledge of a commission of an offence under the POCSO Act must be reported immediately as per Section 19. The act mandates that children and their guardians be informed of their rights to legal aid and representation.\n\n4. **Specific Offences and Penalties:** The Act defines various offences, including penetrative sexual assault and aggravated penetrative sexual assault, and prescribes corresponding penalties. Sections 5 and 6 describe scenarios under which penetrative sexual assault on a child becomes 'aggravated'.\n\n5. **Legal Repercussions for Non-Compliance:** Failure to comply with the procedural requirements, such as not registering an FIR for a cognizable offence under the Act, attracts penal liability.\n\nThese provisions signify the legislative intent to create a robust legal framework focused on protecting children from sexual offences and ensuring timely justice and support for affected children."

    "content": "POCSO stands for the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, enacted in India in 2012. This legislation is designed to protect children under the age of 18 from sexual abuse and exploitation. The Act is comprehensive and gender-neutral, applying to all children. It includes special provisions for child-friendly procedures during investigation and trial to ensure the protection and well-being of the child victim.\n\nKey aspects of POCSO outlined in the provided excerpts include:\n\n1. **Protection of Identity**: The Act emphasizes the protection of the child's identity from being disclosed during media reporting or court procedures unless specifically permitted by a Special Court.\n\n2. **Child-Friendly Court Procedures**: Trials under POCSO are conducted by Special Courts designed to be child-friendly. These courts are instructed to avoid aggressive questioning or character assassination of the child and are to ensure that the child does not see the accused while testifying to avoid intimidation or distress.\n\n3. **In-Camera Trials**: Section 37 states that trials are to be conducted in camera, meaning that the public and media are excluded from the proceedings to protect the child's privacy.\n\n4. **Expeditious Trials**: The Act encourages that trials be conducted as swiftly as possible, ideally within a year, to lessen the prolonged impact on the child.\n\n5. **Compensation for Victims**: The Act provides for victims to receive compensation, managed through legal services authorities, which may be adjusted between interim and final compensation awarded by the court.\n\nOverall, POCSO aims to create a safe and supportive legal environment for child victims of sexual offenses, ensuring their protection and access to justice."
